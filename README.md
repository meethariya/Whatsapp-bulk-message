# Whatsapp-bulk-message
This program can send WhatsApp message corresponding to all the numbers provided in a csv file.
<br>
For this program to run _efficiently_ you need to open your whatsapp on default browser by checking the `keep me logged in` box before running the program and close the tab.<br>
After that open your deafult browser with an `empty tab` so program wont have to open browser again and again instead it'll open just new tabs and close them after sending message.<br>
Make sure to keep the image in **same directory** as the program as it'll wait for the image to come up on screen before performing any actions.
CSV file has columns `numbers` and `message` . You will be required to enter phone number along with its country code.<br><br>
Hope this helpsðŸ˜€
